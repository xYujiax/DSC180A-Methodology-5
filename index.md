1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I thought learning how to write effective prompts that take advantage of LLM's capability to predict the next word was the most interesting topic covered in this domain.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue is recreating a therapist chatbot while implementing guardrails to prevent it from behaving in problematic ways.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Instead of testing only one guardrail, I would like to implement multiple guardrails and test their effectiveness against multiple prompts.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in also implementing a RAG system to provide the chatbot with therapy specific information that would help guide its behavior and accuracy.
